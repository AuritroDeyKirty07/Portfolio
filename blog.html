    <h2>What Building a Pokémon Battle Simulator Taught Me About APIs</h2>

    <p class="post-intro">
      When I started the Pokémon KO Battle project I thought the hard part would be the battle logic.
      I was wrong. The hard part was the API — specifically, learning to handle it gracefully when it was slow, failed, or returned data I didn't expect.
    </p>

    <h3>The Problem With My First Version</h3>
    <p>
      My first attempt fetched Pokémon data and immediately tried to use it. No loading state. No error handling. If the PokéAPI took 3 seconds (which it sometimes does on cold starts), the UI just sat there blank.
      If the fetch failed, the whole app broke silently. Not great.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Actually Learned</h3>
    <p>
      The fix was adding three things I had skipped in my rush to get to the fun stuff:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>A loading skeleton</strong> — placeholder shapes that appear instantly while real data loads. Users know something is happening.</li>
      <li><strong>try/catch around every fetch</strong> — so a failed request shows a friendly error, not a broken screen.</li>
      <li><strong>Data validation</strong> — PokéAPI returns deeply nested objects. I now always check that a property exists before I use it, rather than assuming the shape is always correct.</li>
    </ol>

    <pre class="code-block"><code>// Before (fragile)
const data = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json());
updateUI(data.sprites.front_default);

// After (resilient)
try {
  const res = await fetch(url);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`API error: ${res.status}`);
  const data = await res.json();
  const sprite = data?.sprites?.front_default ?? '/images/fallback.png';
  updateUI(sprite);
} catch (err) {
  showErrorState('Could not load Pokémon. Try again.');
  console.error(err);
}</code></pre>

    <h3>The Bigger Lesson</h3>
    <p>
      Happy-path coding is easy. Real frontend engineering is about what happens when things go wrong.
      Every API call is a promise that might not be kept — and your UI should handle that gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now apply this thinking to every project: what does the user see while waiting? What do they see if something breaks?
      Those two questions make the difference between a project that feels polished and one that just works in demos.

    <h2>You Don't Need a Library for Most CSS Animations</h2>

    <p class="post-intro">
      Reach-for-a-library is a real trap in frontend development. I fell into it early — Animate.css,
      GSAP, Framer Motion. All excellent tools. But I wasn't using them well because I didn't
      understand what they were doing.
    </p>

    <h3>The Scroll Reveal Pattern</h3>
    <p>
      The most common animation on portfolio sites — elements fading in as you scroll — needs zero JavaScript libraries. Here's the entire thing:
    </p>

    <pre class="code-block"><code>/* CSS */
.reveal {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(40px);
  transition: opacity 0.7s ease, transform 0.7s ease;
}
.reveal.active {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}

/* JS — that's it */
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
  entries.forEach(e => {
    if (e.isIntersecting) e.target.classList.add('active');
  });
}, { threshold: 0.15 });

document.querySelectorAll('.reveal').forEach(el => observer.observe(el));</code></pre>

    <h3>When You Actually Need a Library</h3>
    <p>
      Scroll-driven parallax with multiple layers, physics-based spring animations, and complex SVG path morphing —
      these are genuinely hard to build well in raw CSS. That's when GSAP or Framer Motion earn their bundle size.
      But a card hover lift, a fade-in on scroll, a shimmer skeleton? Pure CSS. Every time.
